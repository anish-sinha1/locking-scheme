        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;The purpose of this locking scheme is to synchronize
          access to certain locations on secondary storage, for example, a
          portion of a file. The scheme for this project involves several data
          structures, some of them thread safe, and the usage of several
          synchronization primitives from the PTHREADS library as defined by the
          POSIX standard. The data structures required are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A priority queue. This priority queue is implemented as a binary
            heap, which is one of the most effective ways to implement a
            priority queue. This structure holds a queue of
            <em>transactions</em>. Transactions are opaque data structures and
            nothing should be assumed about them, except that each transaction
            always has a timestamp field of type time_t (a standard UNIX
            timestamp) from the LIBC header file <em>time.h</em>. The priority
            queue makes sure that the order in which the transactions are placed
            in is a minimum order, that is, the transactions are given higher
            priority the lower their timestamp field is. This queue is
            explicitly not thread safe, but it is protected by a wrapper data
            structure which is thread safe.
          </li>
          <li>
            A hash table. This hash table is implemented as an array of
            linked-lists with separate chaining. The hash table depends on the C
            library <em>primesieve.h</em> to generate prime numbers used to
            initially size and also resize the table. This hash table is
            protected by a mutual exclusion lock (mutex) of type
            <code>pthread_mutex_t</code> from the <em>pthread.h</em> header.
            file.

            There are three important parts of the diagram: the non-null
            entries, the transactions, and the null entries. Each is explained
            below:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Transactions represent operations queued to the database. For
                example, a search, insert, or delete. Although the transactions
                appear to be linked together in a list, they are actually all in
                a binary heap which, as mentioned above, serves as the priority
                queue. The internal logic of the heap controls how transactions
                are neatly removed in a way that resembles a linked list. As
                stated above, the transactions are ordered by their unique UNIX
                timestamp.
              </li>
              <li>
                The non-null entries are keys in the hash table. Each non-null
                entry contains the following (in this implementation). A mutex,
                (represented by a <code>pthread_mutex_t</code> structure), a
                pointer to a priority queue, and a thread which loops forever,
                taking items off the queue, locking the mutex if needed,
                performing the operation, and waiting for new operations. If
                there is no operation in the queue, and the thread is idle, the
                entry is destroyed and set to null.
              </li>
              <li>
                The null entries represent an empty entry in the hash table. If
                a page is hashed and that corresponds to an index at which there
                is a null entry, a new non-null entry is created with all the
                required elements as mentioned before (the thread, lock, heap,
                etc.). When the thread running for that particular entry detects
                that there is no more work to do, the entry is turned back into
                a null entry for reuse later.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The order of operations on the global hash table containing locks
            (the lock table) is therefore the following:
            <ol>
              <li>
                The hash table is initialized with no entries and a default size
                of 613 (a prime number)
              </li>
              <li>
                A task is created which requires the locking of a page on the
                disk.
              </li>
              <li>
                The page number and metadata of the page to be locked is hashed
                into an integer modulus the size of the hash table.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now the paths diverge
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If the entry was null, then a new entry is created with this
                    task being the only one in the queue. A thread begins to run
                    which takes this task off the queue and checks if there are
                    any more tasks to be done (if any had been assigned in the
                    time the thread was busy working on the operation). If there
                    are more tasks, the thread continues taking those tasks in
                    order, and if not, the entry is converted back into a null
                    entry, the thread is freed, and the lock is destroyed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the entry was not null, the caller acquires a lock on the
                    hash table and inserts an entry into the priority queue
                    corresponding to that entry. It is taken off the queue,
                    processed, and the results returned to the caller (if any
                    results existed).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
